I am very keen on promoting machine learning concepts and making them accessible to everyone by organizing events, speeches, and hackathons. I am the co-organizer of the Rome Machine Learning & Data Science Meetup, that organizes monthly events in Rome, and a member of the advisory board for Codemotion Italy. I am also a co-founder of the Italian Association for Machine Learning, a not-for-profit organization with the aim of promoting machine learning concepts in the public.",
